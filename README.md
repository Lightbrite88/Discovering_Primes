# Discovering_Primes
 A java program for calculating and outputing primes.

Feature 1
Program will ask for max/min input values, handle them defensively, and use them as a range. 
The program will then calculate and store primes within a list. 
The program will then print to console the list in a readable fashion.

Feature 2
Initial input for choosing between a range or an amount of primes
based on choice, provide furthur input (now can select a start point and number of primes)
Program still outputs similarly.
